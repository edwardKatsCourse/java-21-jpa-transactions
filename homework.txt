JTA Homework
Description:
The system should record all the errors, ever occurred on service layer.
If an error occurs during any user operation - the operation itself must be rolled back, but an error should be recorded to the database

1. Finish implementing all methods, created in classwork
2. Implement user delete. Note: on delete operation, info from both uer tables should be deleted.
3. Create another entity ErrorReport with fields:
- id
- exception type
- message
- timeOccurred

4. All service methods must contain an exception. No method should return the result.
5. When an exception occurs - it is necessary to persist the error report to the database and to rollback the user operation.
6. In methods, that create or update anything in user - the exception must be thrown in the middle or in the end of such method.
If an exception is thrown before the first database operation - it is considered to be cheating.

Hint: one of the possible scenarios of implementing this will be using different propogation layers.
See the end part of the lecture for more details and don't hesitate to google the example of using @Transactional's propogation.

P.S. If you want to achieve the maximum result - it is better to create a project from scratch.
If you do - make sure you create 2 or more tables.
Nothing trains better then your own project, you write from scratch.

I also have an advanced part for those, who dealt with the main part

Good luck!
